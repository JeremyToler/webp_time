# webp_time
 Converts all images in a folder to webp
 There are web frameworks and plugins that do this for you
 I dont know how to use those and I already know how to convert images to webp using PIL so I made this. 

## Usage/Examples

Gina has a folder containing images they want to put on a website but the website is loading slow because the images are so gosh darn big!

```javascript
python webp_time.py /home/gina/best_website_ever_made/content/img 
```

## Features

- Compresses JPEG, JPG and PNG files to WEBP
- Thats it, it just does 1 thing
